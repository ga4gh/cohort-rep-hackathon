# DataSynthesizer
This folder contains datasets generated for the hackathon using DataSynthesizer
See https://github.com/DataResponsibly/DataSynthesizer for details on usage

For each dataset the following is provided

- The description file used to describe the data to be generated
- The generated data as a csv file
- A Data Connect schema (*.data_dict.json) for each dataset

In these examples the description files were generated from dbGaP variable reports that provide frequency distributions for each variable in a study.

e.g. this is [the variable report](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbgap/studies/phs001143/phs001143.v4.p1/pheno_variable_summaries/phs001143.v4.pht005905.v3.p1.TOPMed_WGS_BAGS_Subject_Phenotypes.var_report.xml) used to generate the description for the TOPMed_WGS_BAGS dataset
